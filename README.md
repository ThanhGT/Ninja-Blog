# Getting Started with Create React App

This project is credited to code ninja's tutorial on modern react JS: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5YeuERMmlnqo4oq8vwUpg

This tutorial has taught me about props, routers, and hooks.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

To run the json server you will need to run `npx json-server --watch data/db.json --port 8000`.
